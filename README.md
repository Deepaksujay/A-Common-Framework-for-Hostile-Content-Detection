# A-Common-Framework-for-Hostile-Content-Detection 

In today’s digital age, social media platforms have become a powerful tool for people to share and connect with others. We have different platforms for different modalities of content like Twitter and Google for Text, Instagram and Facebook for Images, Youtube for videos and with the rise of hate and fake content, these platforms have also become a breeding ground for hostile content that can cause harm and division in society. Although there exists many content moderation solutions which are deployed by various MNCs to tackle this issue but they only work well for pure native languages.There exists very little content moderation systems for code-mixed datasets, where multiple languages and scripts are used together, making it challenging to detect and mitigate hostile content effectively. Code-Mixing (CM) is a natural phenomenon of embedding linguistic units such as phrases, words or morphemes of one language into an utterance of another[2].One such example of code mixed dataset is Hinglish where the semantic and linguistic meaning is in Hindi but it is expressed in English text.Following are some examples of the Hinglish text which represent Hate or Fake or Both:  
## T1: ”Koy is bhosidike ko bholo ki match Haar jayenge”  
## T2: ”Arre bhai aj tho trump mar gaya” T3: ”Kriti ke apne kutte ko ma  
## T4: ”Sarkar banne ke badh is desh worst ban gaye”  
Detecting hostile content in code-mixed datasets requires a approach that takes into account the complex linguistic and cultural context in which such content is produced. It involves leveraging advanced technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and data mining to identify patterns and trends that can help distinguish between genuine content and hostile content. The goal is to develop robust algorithms and tools that can automatically detect and flag hostile content in real-time, thereby protecting users from harm and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment. In this article, we will explore some of the latest research and developments in the field of hostile content detection for code-mixed datasets.
